/*
 This program simulates a "data collection station", which joins a multicast
 group in order to receive measures published by thermometers (or other sensors).
 The measures are transported in json payloads with the following format:

   {"timestamp":1394656712850,"location":"kitchen","temperature":22.5}

 Usage: to start the station, use the following command in a terminal

   node station.js
